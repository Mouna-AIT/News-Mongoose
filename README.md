All the News That's Fit to Scrape

Whenever a user visits my site, the app will scrape stories from The Daily Universe and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to my application database. 

The app is scraping and displaying the following information for each article:


 * Headline - the title of the article

 * Summary - a short summary of the article

 * URL - the url to the original article

The users is also able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Then the user will also be able to delete comments left on articles.
